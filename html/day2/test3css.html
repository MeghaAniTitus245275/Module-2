                education:Global warming is the current rise in temperature
                     of the air and oceans. It is happening mainly because humans burn coal,
                      oil, and natural gas; and cut down forests.[2] Average temperatures today are 
                      about 1 °C (1.8 °F) higher than before people started burning a lot of coal around 
                      1750.[3] In some parts of the world it is less and some more. Most climate scientists say 
                      that by the year 2100 temperatures will be 2 °C (3.6 °F) to 4 °C (7.2 °F) 
                    higher than they were before 1750
